# Quantum Architecture Search with Neural Evolutionary Bayesian Optimization

My research on using evolutionary bayesian optimization with a NN as a surrogate model for quantum architecture search, such as designing static quantum circuits or autoML on hybrid quantum variational algos

So far evolutionary bayesian optimization has been completed, just need to make the objective/encoding stuff for the quantum circuits
